# Introduction

This is my Hugo website project, created as part of the **CLD-4300** course during the **January 2025** term.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of static site generation using the Hugo framework. It showcases how to structure content with Markdown, apply themes and templates, and deploy a responsive, fast-loading website.

Through this project, I explored key concepts in modern web development, including content management, site architecture, and customization using configuration files. The experience also provided hands-on practice with tools like Git and Visual Studio Code to manage and publish the site effectively.

This website serves as both a class submission and a personal portfolio piece reflecting the skills and knowledge Iâ€™ve developed throughout the course.

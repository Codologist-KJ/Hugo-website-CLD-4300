# About This Project
Welcome to my Hugo website project, created as part of the CLD-4300 course for the January 2025 term. This site was built to demonstrate my understanding of static website generation, content structuring, and responsive design using the Hugo framework.

The project showcases a practical application of web development principles covered in class, including templating, markdown-based content creation, and deployment best practices. It reflects both technical proficiency and creative design thinking developed throughout the course.

Whether you're a fellow student, instructor, or visitor exploring Hugo-based sites, I hope this project offers a clear and engaging example of modern static site development.
